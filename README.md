# Cellphone-High-Fidelity-Audio-Interface
Project Abstract

We plan to develop and prototype a device that will allow cellphone users to take the full advantage of their music streaming services. Currently, most of the music streaming services like Apple Music and Amazon Music offer Hi Res audio qualities up to 24 bits/192kHz. Nonetheless, the internal DAC of the majority of phones is uncapable of reproducing such signals. An external audio interface must be purchased; these devices tend to be expensive (over 50 CAD), and they depend on the phone to supply power. Additionally, for Apple devices, several adapters need to be daisy chained to be able to connect the phone/tablet to the audio interface. This solution offers an unreliable connection and drains the phone battery.

Consequently, the need for an integrated and reliable solution is needed for iPhone users that enjoy hearing to High Fidelity audio tracks. This solution also needs to have an external power source that releases the phoneâ€™s battery from powering the entire audio system; additionally, being able to charge your phone while listening to music is a good feature that, with the recent market tendency to exclude the 3.5mm jack, has been disappearing.

In principle, this idea can be implemented with just a few inexpensive components; thus, it can offer more features than commercial alternatives at a lower (or comparable) price.
